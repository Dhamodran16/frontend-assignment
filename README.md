## 🔌 Vite React Plugins

This setup supports two official Vite plugins for React:

1. [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react)  
   → Uses **Babel** for fast refresh and JSX transform.

2. [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)  
   → Uses **SWC** (Rust-based compiler) for even faster builds and refresh.
   

Choose one based on your project needs (default: Babel).
